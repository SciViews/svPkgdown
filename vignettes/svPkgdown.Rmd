# A template for {pkgdown} SciViews sites

> This {pkgdown} template is designed specifically for the [SciViews](https://www.sciviews.org) web site. It hard encodes several links (in the header and footer, among other). So, do **not** reuse it elsewhere unmodified!

Some text... and a figure, just for test.
