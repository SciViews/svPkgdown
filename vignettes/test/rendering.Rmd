title: "Output Rendering"
---

This is the `vignettes/test/rendering.Rmd` file from {pkgdown} copied here to see how pages render with the {svPkgdown} style, and amended with more examples.

```{r include = FALSE}
knitr::opts_chunk$set(collapse = TRUE, comment = "#>")
```

The {svPkgdown} styles have been made as close as possible as the styles used in the SciViews blogdown pages at https://www.sciviews.org. However, there are a few differences:

- Presentation of chunks inputs/outputs differ. Here, input and outputs are in the same boxes, and a copy to clipboard button is available at the top right, while in the blogdown, chunks inputs and outputs are separated and styled differently for a better perception (with varying styles for normal outputs, errors and warnings)

- Syntax highlighting use different coloring schemes and here, recognized R functions are links to their man pages on the web.

- Figures and tables are not numbered here, and it is not possible to reference to them (a mechanism available in bookdown/blogdown). Table styling is also a little bit different, and they are left-aligned here while they are centered in blogdown.

### Now a couple of tests.. borrowed from {pkgdown}

This vignette tests {pkgdown} output rendering for several use cases.

# Highlighting

This document uses a variety of linking styles for testing purposes

## Inline code

Local:

* `vignette("svPkgdown")`
* `test()`
* `?test`

Remote:

* `MASS::enlist`
* `MASS::enlist()`
* `?MASS::enlist`
* `%in%`
* `` ?`%in%` ``

## Spurious links

These shouldn't be linked.

* `Authors@R`
* `content-home.html`
* `toc: depth`
* `x = y`

## Code blocks

```{r, eval = FALSE}
# Shouldn't get linked
enlist(5)
# Should get linked
MASS::enlist(5)
```

```{r}
library(MASS)
enlist(5)
```

```{r}
# Should get linked because MASS was loaded previously
enlist(5)
```

# Figures

```{r}
plot(1:10)
```

---

# External files

```{r}
x <- readLines("test.txt")
x
```

# Details tag

<details>
  This should only be shown when required
</details>

<details>
<summary>Some R code</summary>
  
```{r}
1 + 2
```
</details>

# Tables

| col 1 | col 2 | col 3 | col 4 |
|:---------------|:-----------|:-------:|:---------:|
| Brightness     | Total brightness, total reflectance, spectral intensity | $$y = x^2$$ | test |

---

# Mathjax

$$f(x) = \dfrac{1}{\sqrt{2\pi\sigma^2}} e^{-\frac{(x-\mu^2)}{2\sigma^2}}$$

Inline equations: $y=x^2$

# Widgets

Test spacing above widget.

```{r, echo=FALSE}
# set seed for reproducible widget id
if (requireNamespace("htmltools", quietly = TRUE)) {
  htmlwidgets::setWidgetIdSeed(42)
}

library(leaflet)

leaflet() %>%
  addTiles() %>%
  addMarkers(
    lng=174.768,
    lat=-36.852,
    popup="The birthplace of R"
  )
```

Test spacing below widget.

# Crayon

```{r}
cat(crayon::red("This is red"), "\n")

cat(crayon::blue("This is blue\n"), "\n")

message(crayon::green("This is green"))

warning(crayon::bold("This is bold"))
```
Some text

```{r, error = TRUE}
stop(crayon::italic("This is italic"))
```
