# svPkgdown - To do list

- Solve the problem with PDF compilation.

- Make sure packages using {svPkgdown} always use last version.

- Change style (smaller top bar, UMONS colors, fonts matching gitbook, ...).

- A better presentation of the top bar when width is lowered.

- Use the SciViews site footer dynamically (?).

- Test {learnr} tutorials embedded in `inst/tutorials` or `vignettes/tutorials` in {pkgdown} site. They must be published elsewhere ({rsconnect}, for instance).

- Test Shiny, H5P, and youtube applications embedded in .Rmd documents.

- Finalize and test more intensively.
