# svPkgdown 0.1.0

- A new preloader allows to see the page after 1.5s but leaves a small visual cue that the page is still loading at the top left. This way, if badges take a long time to load, one does not have to wait indefinitely!

- The margin at the top of the document was increased by 50 pixels, so that the top bar never (completely) covers the content when the page is loaded.

# svPkgdown 0.1.0

- First version of the pkgdown template, inspired by [tidytemplate](https://github.com/tidyverse/tidytemplate), [rotemplate](https://github.com/ropensci/rotemplate) and [lockedatapkg](https://github.com/lockedatapublished/lockedatapkg).
